## Synopsis
This project introduces concepts of building Python scripts in order to access an API.

### At the end of this project students should be able to explain to anyone, **without the help of Google**:

  * What Bash scripting should not be used for
  * What is an API
  * What is a REST API
  * What are microservices
  * What is the CSV format
  * What is the JSON format
  * Python style guide:
     * Package and module name style
	 * Class name style
	 * Variable name style
	 * Function name style
	 * Constant name style
	 * What is CapWords or CamelCase

### Project Requirements
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
*   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
*   All your files should end with a new line
*   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
*   Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order
*   A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
*   Your code should use the `PEP 8` style
*   All your files must be executable
*   The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
*   All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
*   You must use [get](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get) to access to dictionary value by key (it won't throw an exception if the key doe sn't exist in the dictionary)
*   Your code should not be executed when imported (by using `if __name__ == "__main__":`)
